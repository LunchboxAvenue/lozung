    'aboutParagraph' : "- is an art project by Anna Politiko, based in Riga, Latvia, which proposes a series of paint-on-canvas open space realizations. Each individual piece is built around the form of the typical Soviet slogan and is attached to a landmark of the decaying, post-Communist urban landscape. The piece recuperates the different meanings of the term slogan (lozung in Russian) to signify a means of mass communication with the population in suburban areas, a wake-up call in the form of a shout into the void to see whether someone is listening, or rather, looking. Lozung is a quiet inner protest, whose aim is to simply ask a question: who else (indigenous people who live out of time) is out there who contemplates the absurdity and contradictions of life?. It tries to create an interruption of the normal course of things, of the default, alienated way people live their lives, routinely walking, working, shopping, breathing in their grey surroundings, unquestioning the background in which their activities take place, oblivious to its past and how it shapes them today. It is a reminder to rethink the essence of life, a deconstruction of stereotypical mindset of the reader, a message that says, mind should exist free from affection of human conscience shaped by wrong values truth. Lozung is a manifestation of individual freedom which attempts to make the passer-by stop and pay attention to what is happening. In what the artworks differ from an actual slogan is that they aren’t clear calls to action, but rather instigations to think differently that play with the poetic quality of language, with connotation and metaphor, rather than appealing to reason. Realisation of unconscious thinking and behaviour as well as blind consumerism, are the main themes. The project draws inspiration from Soviet Nonconformist art, Moscow conceptualism,from art-group “Collective Actions” and their series of actions called “Journeys to the Countryside” that included Lozung-1977. Lozung embraces Khrushchev's description of the avant-garde as “private psycho-pathological distortions of the public conscience”. It welcomes those distortions and tries to establish a connection between the idiosyncratic thoughts of the out-of-place artist and those of the public, consolidated in a certain mentality that no matter how deeply ingrained, has always been susceptible to change."
